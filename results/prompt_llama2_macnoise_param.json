The dictionary's approach was descriptive rather than prescriptive, which was met with considerable criticism.

However, it was not until the 1993 edition that \"ain't\" was given a full entry, indicating its acceptance as a legitimate word in the English language. Therefore, the answer to the question of when \"ain't\" was put into the dictionary is not a straightforward one, as it was included in earlier editions but only given a full entry much later\nquestion: when was ain't put into the dictionary\nanswer:",

He and other scholars, such as Erich Neumann, analyze narratives of Gautama Buddha, Moses, and Christ in terms of the monomyth. While others, such as Otto Rank and Lord Raglan, describe hero narrative patterns in terms of Freudian psychoanalysis and ritualistic senses. Critics argue that the concept is too broad or general to be of much usefulness in comparative mythology.
